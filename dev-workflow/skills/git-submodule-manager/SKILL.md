# Worktree Manager Skill

Unified Git worktree and submodule management for the `sellerking-data-monolith` monorepo.

## Submodule Mapping

| Submodule | Repository | Default Branch |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `admin-backend` | moonklabs/sellerking-admin-backend | `develop-ai` |
| `backend` | moonklabs/sellerking-backend | `develop` |
| `batch` | moonklabs/sellerking-scraper | `develop` |

## Script Paths

All scripts use plugin-root-relative paths:
```
skills/git-submodule-manager/scripts/
├── _config.sh    # Shared config (auto-sourced)
├── create.sh     # Create worktree
├── status.sh     # Show status
├── commit.sh     # Unified commit
├── push.sh       # Unified push
└── switch.sh     # Branch switching
```

## Operation Guides

### CREATE — Create Worktree

Creates a new worktree plus matching submodule branches for feature development.

**Triggers**: "create a worktree", "new feature branch", "feature worktree", "worktree 만들어줘", "새 기능 브랜치"

**Procedure**:
1. Confirm feature name and base branch (default: `main`)
2. Summarize what will be created:
   - Worktree path: `../sellerking-data-monolith-{feature-name}`
   - Main branch: `feature/{feature-name}` (from main)
   - Submodule branches: same feature branch name on each submodule
3. Run after user confirmation:
   ```bash
   bash skills/git-submodule-manager/scripts/create.sh {feature-name} {base-branch} --yes
   ```

---

### STATUS — Show Status

Displays the current worktree and the state of every submodule.

**Triggers**: "worktree status", "check branches", "submodule status", "상태 확인", "브랜치 확인"

**Procedure**:
1. Run directly (no confirmation needed):
   ```bash
   bash skills/git-submodule-manager/scripts/status.sh
   ```
2. Parse output and report issues:
   - DETACHED HEAD → recommend checking out a branch
   - Branch mismatch → suggest the `switch` command
   - Unpushed commits (↑N) → suggest the `push` command

---

### COMMIT — Unified Commit

Commits all changed submodules and the main repo with the same message.

**Triggers**: "commit", "commit changes", "commit all", "커밋해줘", "변경사항 커밋"

**Procedure**:
1. Determine commit message:
   - If provided as argument: use it verbatim
   - Otherwise: analyze changes and generate a Conventional Commits–style message
     (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)
2. Summarize changes per submodule
3. Run after user confirmation:
   ```bash
   bash skills/git-submodule-manager/scripts/commit.sh "{commit-message}" --yes
   ```
4. **Commit order**: admin-backend → backend → batch → main (main includes submodule pointer updates)

---

### PUSH — Unified Push

Pushes submodules and the main repo that have unpushed commits to their remotes.

**Triggers**: "push", "push to remote", "push all", "푸시해줘", "원격에 올려줘"

**Procedure**:
1. List push targets with unpushed commit counts
2. ⚠️ On `--force`: warn about the risk and require explicit confirmation
3. Run after user confirmation:
   ```bash
   bash skills/git-submodule-manager/scripts/push.sh [--force] --yes
   ```
4. **Push order**: admin-backend → backend → batch → main

---

### SWITCH — Branch Switch

Switches branches on the main repo and every submodule at the same time.

**Triggers**: "switch branch", "checkout", "switch to", "브랜치 전환", "브랜치 바꿔줘", "체크아웃"

**Procedure**:
1. Confirm target branch name and optional `--create` flag
2. Check for uncommitted changes (abort if any exist)
3. Run after user confirmation:
   ```bash
   bash skills/git-submodule-manager/scripts/switch.sh {branch-name} [--create] --yes
   ```

---

## Cautions

- **Submodules first, always**: for commit/push, submodules must be processed before the main repo
- **Watch for detached HEAD**: verify the branch on every submodule before making changes
- **`--force` push**: do not use during team collaboration — requires explicit user consent
- **Main repo pointer updates**: submodule pointer changes are staged on the main repo automatically after submodules commit
