## Writing Principles

### Quantitative Data Presentation

```
❌ Avoid                           ✅ Recommended
"will be accomplished"            "verified as of [date]"
"market is expected to be large"  "TAM ₩X trillion per [Research Institute] 2025"
"many customers"                  "123 paying customers, MRR ₩28M"
"growing rapidly"                 "15% MoM growth (2025.01~06, 6-month avg)"
"unique technology"               "3x faster than competitors, 2 patents held"
```

### Killer Phrases by Section

**Technology Differentiation:**
- "Applied ○○ technology for the first time globally to ~~"
- "X% accuracy improvement, Y% cost reduction vs. existing methods"
- "TRL 7 achieved — prototype validation complete, production-ready stage"

**Market Analysis:**
- "Korea's ○○ market is ₩X trillion per [Research Institute] 2025"
- "X% annual growth (CAGR 2024~2029, source: ○○)"

**Team Capability:**
- "Founder graduated from ○○ University, ○○ major, X years of ○○ experience at ○○"
- "Lead developer ○○ holds X patents in ○○"

## Score-Based Page Allocation

When total pages are fixed, allocate space proportionally to scoring weights:

Example — 20-page business plan, TIPS program:
- Technology Development (40%): 8 pages
- Market Analysis + Commercialization Strategy (30%): 6 pages
- Team Capability + Company Overview (20%): 4 pages
- Financial Plan + Other (10%): 2 pages

---

## Page/Character Limit Management

- **Exceeding page limit:** Compress lowest-scoring sections first (expected impact, timeline)
- **Character limit:** Tables/bullets can convey same information in 20-30% less space
- **Table usage:** Competitive comparison, financial plan, and timeline are best presented as tables for evaluator readability
